# Practicum Data Science Project
## Machine Learning for Mobile Package Recommendation

### Description
Megaline, the mobile operator, is dissatisfied because many of their customers are still using old packages. The company wants to develop a model that can analyze consumer behavior and recommend one of their two latest packages: Smart or Ultra.

You have access to customer behavior data from those who have switched to the new packages (from the Statistical Data Analysis course project). In this classification task, you need to develop a model that can accurately select the package. Since you have completed the data preprocessing steps, you can proceed directly to the model creation stage.

Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. For this project, the threshold for the accuracy level is set at 0.75. Evaluate the accuracy metric of your model using the test dataset.

### Objectives
Develop a model with the highest accuracy with minimum threshold of 0.75.
